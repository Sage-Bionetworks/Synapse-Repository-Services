/**
 * <p>
 * Object replication data is normally kept in-synch with the truth by the
 * {@link ObjectReplicationWorker} by listening to object change events.
 * However, message delivery is not guaranteed so a secondary process is needed
 * to ensure the entity replication data is kept up-to-date with the truth.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This worker reconciles discrepancies between the truth and the replicated data for
 * a given list of container IDs. This worker is driven by query events. Each time a query
 * is executed against the object replication data, an event is generated that
 * includes the container IDs involved in the query. For example, when a query
 * is executed against a table view, an event is generated that includes that
 * IDs of the view's fully expanded scope. This worker 'listens' to these events
 * and performs delta checking for each container ID that has not been checked
 * in the past 1000 minutes. When deltas are detected, change events are generated
 * to trigger the {@link ObjectReplicationWorker} to create, update, or deleted
 * object replicated data as needed.
 * </p>

	<p align="center"><h3>Synapse Terms and Conditions of Use</h3></p>
	<p>Last updated: <strong>March 18, 2013</strong></p>
	<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
	<p>Welcome to Synapse, a service operated by Sage Bionetworks, an IRS 501(c)(3) public charity<strong> </strong>(&ldquo;<strong>Sage Bionetworks</strong>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<strong>we</strong>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;<strong>us</strong>&rdquo;). These Terms and Conditions of Use (&ldquo;<strong>Terms</strong>&rdquo;) are a binding legal agreement between you and Sage Bionetworks regarding your use of Synapse, Sage Bionetworks&rsquo; computational and storage software platform enabling collaborative, data-driven research on integrative genomic datasets, including any replacements thereof and successors thereto (&ldquo;<strong>Synapse</strong>&rdquo; or the &ldquo;<strong>Service</strong>&rdquo;). Synapse is comprised of a publicly-available portion designed to enable combined analysis of genomic data (the &ldquo;<strong>Synapse Commons</strong>&rdquo;), as well as workspaces on Synapse designated as private by a Synapse user (&ldquo;<strong>Private Workspaces</strong>&rdquo;). Unless otherwise indicated in these Terms, all references to Synapse and the Service include both the Synapse Commons and Private Workspaces.<br />
	  Please read these Terms carefully. By using Synapse, or downloading, uploading, installing, or using any genomic, molecular, phenotypic and/or other data from human or non-human sources (&ldquo;<strong>Data</strong>&rdquo;), any algorithms, tools, and other software code in source or object form (&ldquo;<strong>Software</strong>&rdquo;), or any other information and content (such content, including Software, is referred to in these Terms as &ldquo;<strong>Content</strong>&rdquo;) available on or through Synapse, you agree to be bound by this Agreement and use Synapse and all Data and Content in compliance with this Agreement. If you are using the Service on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the legal authority to bind such company or entity to this Agreement.<br />
	  In addition, when using certain features of Synapse, you also will be subject to the guidelines, terms, and agreements applicable to such features (&ldquo;<strong>Policies</strong>&rdquo;). For example, the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.synapse.org/static/governance/SynapsePrivacyPolicy.pdf">Synapse Privacy Policy</a> describes the personal information Sage Bionetworks collects in connection to Synapse, and how we use and disclose such information. All such Policies, including the Synapse Privacy Policy and the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.synapse.org/static/governance/SynapseCommonsDataUseProcedure.pdf">Synapse Commons Data Use Procedure</a> are incorporated by reference into these Terms. If these Terms are inconsistent with any Policy, the terms in the Policy will control to the extent of the inconsistency. <br />
	  We may periodically make changes to these Terms and will identify the date of last update. We will post the updated Terms on Synapse and will also notify registered users when they log-onto Synapse of any material changes to these Terms, so please keep your registered email address current. Changes to the Terms will be effective upon being posted on Synapse, except as set forth below. Material changes to these Terms will be effective 30 days from posting of such change or receiving notification by email (&ldquo;<strong>Effective Date</strong>&rdquo;). We encourage you to review the most recent version of the Terms frequently and remain informed of any changes to these Terms. If you continue to use Synapse after we modify these Terms, you will be deemed to have consented to terms of the modified agreement for your use of Synapse as of the date of the modification. If you do not agree to any provision of these Terms, you must not use Synapse. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<ol class="akl">
	  <li><strong>Eligibility</strong></li>
	</ol>
	<p>You must be 13 years of age or older to use Synapse. Use of Synapse is void where prohibited. You represent and warrant that any information you submit to the Services or otherwise to Sage Bionetworks, during registration or otherwise, is true and accurate, that you are 13 years of age or older, and that you are fully able and competent to enter into and abide by these Terms. Each account on Synapse may be used by one human, and each human may create only a single account.</p>
	<ol>
	  <li><strong>Account Registration </strong></li>
	</ol>
	<p>You must register to use certain features of Synapse. When you register, you agree to (a)&nbsp;provide accurate, current and complete information about you as may be prompted by registration forms on Synapse (&ldquo;<strong>Registration Data</strong>&rdquo;); (b)&nbsp;maintain the security of any logins, passwords, or other credentials that you select or that are provided to you for use on Synapse; and (c) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data, and any other information you provide to us, and to keep all such information accurate, current, and complete. You will notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security by emailing us at Synapaseinfo@sagebase.org. If messages sent to an email address provided by you are returned as undeliverable, we reserve the right to terminate your account immediately with or without notice to you and without any liability to you or any third party, subject to applicable law.</p>
	<ol>
	  <li><strong>Fees; No Refunds</strong><strong> </strong></li>
	</ol>
	<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
	<p>Access to the Service presently is provided to you free of charge. Sage Bionetworks reserves the right to implement fees or change the fees for Synapse, or portions thereof, at any time by providing you notice on Synapse or otherwise. </p>
	<ol>
	  <li><strong>Access to and Use of Data and other Content</strong></li>
	</ol>
	<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
	<ol>
	  <ol>
	    <li><strong>Overview</strong></li>
	  </ol>
	</ol>
	<p>Synapse gives registered users the ability to upload and make available to other users Data and Software. Any Data or Software that is posted or transmitted by any user of Synapse other than Sage Bionetworks is referred to in these Terms as &ldquo;<strong>User Materials</strong>.&rdquo;<br />
	  Data will be made available through the Synapse Commons using a three-tier data use system, as discussed in greater detail in the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.synapse.org/static/governance/SynapseCommonsDataUseProcedure.pdf">Synapse Commons Data Use Procedure</a> and the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.synapse.org/static/governance/SynapsePrivacyPolicy.pdf">Synapse Privacy Policy</a> (collectively, the &ldquo;<strong>Synapse Commons Data Terms of Use</strong>&rdquo;). This Section 4(a) contains a brief overview of the three-tier data use systems for the Synapse Commons, but you should review the Synapse Commons Data Terms of Use carefully. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this Section 4(a) and the Synapse Commons Data Terms of Use, the Synapse Commons Data Terms of Use govern to the extent of the conflict or inconsistency.<br />
	  While it is Sage Bionetworks&rsquo; policy to promote Data sharing with as few restrictions as possible (Open Data) on the Synapse Commons, the Synapse Commons accommodates Data sharing under restricted conditions when required by informed consent, legal contract and/or privacy requirements as disclosed by the Data contributor (Restricted or Controlled Data). This process is designed to allow Data sharing within the legal and ethical framework for responsible use of genomic Data.</p>
	<p>-<strong> </strong><strong>Open Data (&ldquo;Tier 1&rdquo;) </strong>includes data that may be shared with every Registered Synapse user in an unrestricted manner. Users have authority to access all Open Data following agreement to these Terms and Conditions of Use. <br />
	  -<strong> </strong><strong>Restricted Data (&ldquo;Tier 2&rdquo;)</strong> includes data that may be shared only following user agreement to comply with additional data-specific terms. These terms are imposed only when required to maintain protections, regulatory or legal conditions described as part of informed consent or legal contracts enacted during the process of Data generation and disclosed by the Data contributor. <br />
	  -<strong> </strong><strong>Controlled Data (&ldquo;Tier 3&rdquo;)</strong> includes data requiring additional protections for human subjects, like sensitive information or data from &ldquo;vulnerable populations&rdquo; as defined using <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/index.html">OHRP guidelines</a> and by the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/index_en.htm">European Data Protection Directive</a> and its implementation in applicable local law. Sharing of controlled data is considered to confer more than minimal additional risk of re-identification and/or harm to human participants and contribution or use of these data requires independent review/monitoring. <br />
	  Individuals interested in submitting Data to the Synapse Commons must comply with the Synapse Commons Data Terms of Use, including their requirement to work with Sage Bionetworks to ensure that Data is shared using the appropriate terms of use and restrictions. <br />
	  Subject to applicable law, we take no responsibility and assume no liability for any User Materials posted, stored, or uploaded by you or any third party, or for any loss or damage to any User Materials. Although we have no obligation to screen, edit, or monitor any User Materials posted on or transmitted through Synapse (other than Data posted to the Synapse Commons, to the extent described in the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.synapse.org/static/governance/SynapseCommonsDataUseProcedure.pdf">Synapse Commons Data Use Procedure</a> and the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.synapse.org/static/governance/SynapsePrivacyPolicy.pdf">Synapse Privacy Policy</a>),<strong> </strong>we reserve the right, and have discretion, to remove and screen, any User Materials posted, stored, or transmitted on or through Synapse at any time and without notice. </p>
	<p>Moreover, we provide you with the opportunity to use Private Workspaces on Synapse, and to only designate Content and Data as accessible to certain other Synapse users. We take reasonable measures in an effort to ensure that access to such Content or Data, or to any Private Workspace, by unauthorized individuals or entities will not occur, but we cannot guarantee that any such unauthorized access will not occur and make no representations or warranties in this regard. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong>Licensing</strong></p>
	<p><strong>Software and Data</strong></p>

	</ol>
	<p>We respect the intellectual property rights of others, and ask you to do the same. It is our policy to terminate the access privileges of those who repeatedly infringe the copyright rights of others. If you believe that your work has been posted on Synapse in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please contact us at the address below and provide the following information: (a) an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest; (b) a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed, and identification of the time(s) and date(s) the material that you claim is infringing was displayed on Synapse; (c) your address, telephone number, and email address; (d) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (e) a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner&rsquo;s behalf. </p>
	<p>If you believe that your User Materials that were removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the content in your User Content, you may send a counter-notice containing the following information to the copyright agent: (a) your physical or electronic signature; (b) identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled; (c) a statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the content; and (d) your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in Seattle, Washington, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement. If a counter-notice is received by the copyright agent, we may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at our sole discretion.</p>

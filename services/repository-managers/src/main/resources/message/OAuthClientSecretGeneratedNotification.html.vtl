Dear $displayName,
</p>
<p>
A secret for an OAuth Client ($clientName) was just generated. If a secret was previously generated for this client it will stop working and your application might need to be updated. 
</p>
<p>
A client secret should be treated like a password, please make sure that it is kept in a secure place.
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions, please submit a request to the <a href="https://sagebionetworks.jira.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/9">Synapse Service Desk</a>.
</p>
<p>
Sincerely,
</p>
<p>
Synapse Team

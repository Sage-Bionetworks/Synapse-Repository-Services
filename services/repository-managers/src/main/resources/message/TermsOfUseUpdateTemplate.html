<p>
Dear Synapse User,
</p>
<p>
We are rolling out changes to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy on <strong>Nov 15, 2024</strong>.
<p>
Changes include the addition of a new tiered plan tied to the amount of data you store on Synapse and the services you use.
These changes are designed to provide greater clarity, enhance user protections, and ensure compliance with current laws and regulations. 
They also reflect the evolving nature of our services and user needs.</p>
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions about these changes or the continuation of your service, please contact us through our <a href="https://sagebionetworks.jira.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/9">Service Desk</a> or send an email to <a href="mailto:privacyofficer@sagebionetworks.org?subject=Terms of Service and Privacy Policy Update Information">privacyofficer@sagebionetworks.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
You can find <a href="https://www.synapse.org/TrustCenter:TermsOfService">the new terms here</a> and a summary of the changes is included in the Q&A below. You are receiving this because you are a registered user of our data services.
</p>
<p>
Sincerely,
</p>
<p>
The Sage Bionetworks Team
</p>
<h3>What will this mean for you?​</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you store data on Synapse, <u>nothing will change for your existing Synapse Project(s).</u></li>
<li>Nothing will change for contributions to NIH-designated repositories. For example:
	<ul>
	<li>If you want to add a new project to an existing Data Coordinating Center (e.g. AD Knowledge Portal or Project GENIE) which is already covered by a grant funding mechanism.</li>
	<li>If you request to share data directly via a Sage-managed Knowledge Portal.</li>
	</ul>
<li>If you only download data and don’t use Synapse for storing data, then you will not be impacted by any changes.</li>
<li>As of <strong>Nov 15, 2024</strong>, if you add data to, or require additional services for, your existing Synapse Project, or create a new Synapse Project, the following changes will apply:
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Basic Hosting Plan:</strong> If you are looking to store less than 100GB of data, nothing will change. This storage is part of our Basic Hosting Plan and is FREE.</li> 
	<li><strong>Self-Managed Plan:</strong> If you are looking to store between 100GB and 500GB of data, you can sign up for a paid Self-Managed Plan. Plans include support for set-up and Governance consulting. Visit <a href="https://help.synapse.org/docs/Sage-Offerings.2965078125.html">the Sage Offering Help Page</a> for more information.</li>
	<li><strong>Data Coordination Plan:</strong> If you’d like to store over 500GB or need additional services or customized solutions, you will be part of our Data Coordination Plan, for which a customized project and quote will be generated. This includes multi-center consortiums seeking a Data Coordinating Center.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

For more detailed information on the Synapse Offerings, or if you have questions about your existing project, you can visit <a href="https://help.synapse.org/docs/Sage-Offerings.2965078125.html">the Sage Offering Help Page</a> or contact us through our <a href="https://sagebionetworks.jira.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/9">Service Desk</a>.

<h3>Why are these changes taking effect?​</h3>
<ul>
<li>The new plan offerings allow us to provide users with project set-up and governance support, as well as guidance on adhering to the <a href="https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy">NIH Data Management and Sharing Policy</a>. All of this will help support new and existing users to share, manage and reuse data.</li> 
<li>As a nonprofit organization, our primary mission is to provide scientific communities with access to high-quality biomedical data to help advance human health. However, maintaining accessible data long-term does come at a cost, e.g. storage and governance services. The changes to our Synapse offerings will help offset a fraction of these costs and maintain the openness of these data for as many people as possible.</li> 
</ul>
<h3>What action do you need to take?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Please review the updated Terms of Service and Privacy Policy carefully. When you sign into Synapse after <strong>Nov 15, 2024</strong>, these will also be available to review and acknowledge.</li>
<li>If you do not agree to these updated terms and policies, you may discontinue the use of our services.</li>

These updates introduce new features and tiered service plans, enhance user protections, address legal and regulatory changes, and provide greater clarity.

<h3>What do the new tiered service plans mean for you?​</h3>

<ul>
<li>If you already store data on Synapse, nothing will change to your existing Synapse Project(s).</li>
<li>Nothing will change for contributions to NIH-designated repositories. For example:
	<ul>
	<li>If you want to add a new project to an existing Data Coordinating Center (e.g. AD Knowledge Portal or Project GENIE) which is already covered by a grant funding mechanism.</li>
	<li>If you request to share data directly via a Sage-managed Knowledge Portal.</li>
	</ul>
<li>If you only download data and don't use Synapse for storing data, then you will not be impacted by any changes.</li>
<li>As of <strong>November 15, 2024</strong>, if you add data to, or require additional services for your existing Synapse Project, or create a new Synapse Project, the following changes will apply:
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Basic Hosting Plan:</strong> If you are looking to store less than 100GB of data, nothing will change. This storage is part of our Basic Hosting Plan and is FREE.</li> 
	<li><strong>Self-Managed Plan:</strong> If you are looking to store between 100GB and 500GB of data, you can sign up for a paid Self-Managed Plan. Plans include support for set-up and Governance consulting. Visit the <a href="https://help.synapse.org/docs/Sage-Offerings.2965078125.html">Sage Offering Help Page</a> for more information.</li>
	<li><strong>Data Coordination Plan:</strong> If you'd like to store over 500GB or need additional services or customized solutions, you will be part of our Data Coordination Plan, for which a customized project and quote will be generated. This includes multi-center consortiums seeking a Data Coordinating Center.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<p>

<h3>What are the key changes to the Sage Privacy Policy?</h3>

The full Privacy Policy can be reviewed <a href="https://www.synapse.org/TrustCenter:PrivacyPolicy">here</a>. In summary, the key changes include the following:
<ol>
<li>Expanded Scope: The policy now covers all Sage Bionetworks services, not just Synapse.</li>
<li>Enhanced Transparency: We provide more detailed explanations of data collection methods, including automated collection via cookies and analytics.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Why are these changes taking effect?​</h3>

<ul>
<li>The new plan offerings allow us to provide users with project set-up and governance support, as well as guidance on adhering to the <a href="https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy">NIH Data Management and Sharing Policy</a>. All of this will help support new and existing users to share, manage and reuse data.</li> 
<li>As a nonprofit organization, our primary mission is to provide scientific communities with access to high-quality biomedical data to help advance human health. However, maintaining accessible data long-term does come at a cost, e.g. storage and governance services. The changes to our Synapse offerings will help offset a fraction of these costs and maintain the openness of these data for as many people as possible.</li> 
</ul>

<h3>What action do you need to take?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Please review the updated Terms of Service and Privacy Policy carefully. When you sign into Synapse after <strong>November 15, 2024</strong>, these will also be available to review and acknowledge.</li>
<li>If you do not agree to these updated terms and policies, you may discontinue the use of our services.</li>
</ul>

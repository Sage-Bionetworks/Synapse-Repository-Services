The Access Requirement mechanism is distinct from the access control list in that it is controlled not by the entity owner but by a separate authority:  Access Requirements are created and maintained by the Synapse Access and Compliance Team (ACT).  ACTAccessRequirements can only be approved by the ACT.  Self-sign Access Requirements can be approved by the user desiring access, but said user first has to meet 'terms of use' associated with the requirement.",

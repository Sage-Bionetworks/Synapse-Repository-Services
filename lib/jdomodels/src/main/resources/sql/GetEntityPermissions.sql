/*
 * For each entity, the RECURSIVE BEN table will contain one row for the entity plus an additional row for each entity in its
 * hierarchy until an ACL is found.  Note: Only the last row with an ACL_ID will have a correct benefactorId.  The finally
 * BEN table will only contain the last valid row for each entity since all rows with null ACL ids are filtered out.
 * 
 * The ACC table will contain one row for each distinct permission that the user has been granted to any of their principals
 * on the ACL identified from the BEN table.
 * 
 * The final table pivots each row from the ACC table to a column by grouping on the entity id.
